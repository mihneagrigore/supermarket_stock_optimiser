      <h2>Why Stock Optimizer Exists</h2>
      <p>
        Inventory management is one of the most expensive operational problems
        in retail. Overstock leads to waste. Understock leads to lost revenue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stock Optimizer bridges that gap by combining historical data,
        real-time inputs, and predictive models into a single platform
        that’s easy to use and hard to outgrow.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="about-highlight">
      <ul>
        <li>✔ Reduce overstock and expired products</li>
        <li>✔ Forecast demand with confidence</li>
        <li>✔ Centralize CSV, receipts, and predictions</li>
        <li>✔ Make decisions faster, with less risk</li>
